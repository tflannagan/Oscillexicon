         To spread a thought based in balanced and treated with love. In observance of the natural state between all states of matter. The encompasing defualt status of the universe. All objects, small or large adhere to this natural law. The law of oscillation. Like the tides forever bound to rise and fall, we are bound by this defualt status. <br />
         
         It is our goal to create an encompasing set of ways to live our lives centered around this idea. An idea that stems from something that exists in the old stories passed on from generations, light and dark, chaos and order, good and evil. An idea that also exists within the laws of science. There are endless scientific properties that represent this phenomenon that range from more simpler concepts, such as vibration or magnetism to more complex practices, like sound design and string theory.<br /> There is a bridge here. We need to build one together. <br />
         <strong>This idea should be shared and accesible to all humans who will be impacted by it. Because of this, we ask you all the contribute to the open source project intended to reach all those that resonate with this idea.</strong>
