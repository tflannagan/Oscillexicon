            Oscillationism is a philosophy that embraces the natural state of
            the universe and recognizes that all objects, whether they are small
            or large, adhere to the laws of oscillation. The principle of
            oscillation is a fundamental law that governs everything in the
            universe, from the tides of the ocean to the vibrations of subatomic
            particles.

            By understanding and being aware of the oscillations of the

            This includes physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual domains.
            Oscillationism teaches that all aspects of life are interconnected
            and can be harmonized by adjusting according to our reference.

            At the heart of Oscillationism lies the profound understanding of
            the transformative power of frequency and vibration. The esteemed
            inventor Nikola Tesla once said, "If you want to find the secrets of
            the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."

            The beginning of the universe is explained as Igniculus Oscillatar,

            to be the source of all oscillations and the driving force behind
            the prosperity of life. It is thought that by connecting with IO, we
